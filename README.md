# 420X-Turmite-Simulation

A simulation of what [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) might look like at a colony scale.

*When two ants collide one is annihilated* This is due to the fact that all processing is delayed to the GPU and as such neighbors are not aware of each other's presence.
